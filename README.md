<p>**This mod should be considered in progress and untested.</p>
<p>At a minimum, you will probably need to widen some of the mounting screw holes and clearance some parts after printing.</p>
<p>I offer no instructions for assembly, and no bill of materials, but you should be able to use the included model files to aid with most of that.</p>

<p>I based the design on the Endorphin3D mod for the Ender 5 series of printers.  I couldn't use the original design with my Ender 5+ because some of the framing members interfered with the linear rail locations and mounts, so I used it as reference to design my own.  None of the parts of the Endorphin mod are used in my design, and would likely not be entirely compatible as it would throw off belt alignments.</p>

<p>I have printed and installed the gantry mounts, toolhead assembly, Y belt idlers, and X axis idler tower.  In it's current configuration, the design assumes NEMA23 steppers for X and Y.  You will need to modify the design for NEMA17 steppers (paying close attention to belt alignment) in order to use it with the stock stepper motors.</p>

<p>There is an improved experimental X idler tower in the model files that I haven't tested yet, but should offer more adjustment.</p>

<p>Sorry about the mess, I've had no training in parametric design or CAD, I just tinker with it in my free time.</p>
